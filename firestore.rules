/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset secures a physiotherapy information application.
 * It establishes a security model where core informational content (like therapist
 * profiles, medical conditions, and treatment guides) is publicly readable by
 * anyone, but can only be modified by administrators. User-submitted data, such
 * as appointments and contact form messages, are treated as "write-only" drop boxes
 * for most users, but are fully manageable by admins.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into logical top-level collections.
 * - /therapists: Publicly viewable therapist profiles.
 * - /products: Publicly viewable product listings.
 * - /conditions: Publicly viewable medical condition information.
 * - /treatmentGuides: Publicly viewable treatment guides.
 * - /subscriptionPlans: Publicly viewable subscription plans.
 * - /contactFormSubmissions: A collection for contact form entries, readable by admins.
 * - /admins: A private list of user UIDs with administrator privileges.
 *
 * Subcollections are used to establish clear relationships:
 * - /therapists/{therapistId}/appointments: Appointments are nested under the
 *   therapist they are for. Writable by anyone, but only manageable by admins.
 * - /therapists/{therapistId}/availability: Availability for a therapist. Publicly readable
 *   but manageable only by admins.

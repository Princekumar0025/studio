/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset secures a physiotherapy information application.
 * It establishes a security model where core informational content (like therapist
 * profiles, medical conditions, and treatment guides) is publicly readable by
 * anyone, but can only be modified by administrators. User-submitted data, such
 * as appointments and contact form messages, are treated as "write-only" drop boxes
 * for most users, but are fully manageable by admins.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into logical top-level collections.
 * - /therapists: Publicly viewable therapist profiles.
 * - /products: Publicly viewable product listings.
 * - /conditions: Publicly viewable medical condition information.
 * - /contactFormSubmissions: A collection for contact form entries, readable by admins.
 * - /admins: A private list of user UIDs with administrator privileges.
 *
 * Subcollections are used to establish clear relationships:
 * - /therapists/{therapistId}/appointments: Appointments are nested under the
 *   therapist they are for. Writable by anyone, but only manageable by admins.
 * - /therapists/{therapistId}/availability: Availability for a therapist. Publicly readable
 *   but manageable only by admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read-Only Content: The 'therapists' and 'products'
 *   collections are world-readable to serve the app's informational purpose.
 *   Write operations are restricted to admins to ensure data integrity.
 * - Admin-Managed Content: 'conditions', 'appointments', and therapist 'availability'
 *   are fully manageable by admins.
 * - Write-Only Drop Boxes: The 'appointments' and 'contactFormSubmissions'
 *   collections allow any user (including anonymous ones) to create documents.
 *   However, read and modification access is restricted to prevent users from
 *   viewing other users' sensitive information, except for admins.
 * - Admin Role Management: An '/admins' collection stores the UIDs of admin users.
 *   The `isAdmin()` function checks for the existence of the requesting user's UID
 *   in this collection. Admins can manage the list of other admins. The first admin
 *   must be added manually through the Firebase Console.
